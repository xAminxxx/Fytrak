## Objective

Ship shared backend contracts and trainee onboarding through coach assignment + chat thread bootstrap.

## Stories

   - Signup/login
   - Role-based route guard (trainee/coach/admin)
   - Acceptance: user lands on correct role entry screen

2. **Trainee onboarding + assignment state**
   - Basic profile completion
   - Assignment state handling (`unassigned`, `pending`, `assigned`)
   - Acceptance: state updates reflected immediately in UI

3. **Coach discovery + invite request**
   - Discover list with ranking (verified first)
   - Invite via code/email/username
   - Send assignment request with optional intro message
   - Acceptance: request appears in coach pending queue

4. **Coach request decision path**
   - Coach can accept/reject request
   - Accept creates coach-trainee link

   - Acceptance: one active coach constraint enforced

5. **Chat thread bootstrap**
   - 1:1 trainee-coach thread creation on assignment
   - Text messaging read/unread + timestamp
   - Acceptance: messages sync in real time

6. **Chat image attachments via Cloudinary**
   - Pick image, compress, upload to Cloudinary preset
   - Store metadata in Firestore message
   - Acceptance: receiver can view image in chat
